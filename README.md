# Awesome edge computing

# Simulators
- [iFogSim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim): The iFogSim Toolkit for Modeling 
and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and 
Fog Computing Environments.

- [EdgeCloudSim](https://github.com/CagataySonmez/EdgeCloudSim): EdgeCloudSim: An 
Environment for Performance Evaluation of Edge Computing Systems.

- [pFogSim](https://github.com/jihall77/pFogSim): pFogSim (/p/-fôg-/sɪm/) is a 
play off iFogSim; A simulator made to handle large-scale FOG networks with the 
HAFA Puddle Strategy to help evaluate the potential advantages/disadvantages 
within user-customizable scenarios.


# Frameworks
- [OMNeT++](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp): OMNeT++ is a public-source, 
component-based, modular and open-architecture simulation environment with strong
GUI support and an embeddable simulation kernel. Its primary application area is
the simulation of communication networks, but it has been successfully used in 
other areas like the simulation of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware 
architectures and business processes as well.


# Test (data, benchmark)
- [DeFog](https://github.com/qub-blesson/DeFog): DeFog, a first Fog benchmarking 
suite to: (i) alleviate the burden of Fog benchmarking by using a standard 
methodology, and (ii) facilitate the understanding of the target platform by 
collecting a catalogue of relevant metrics for a set of benchmarks.
