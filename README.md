# Awesome edge computing

# Simulators
- [iFogSim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/iFogSim): The iFogSim Toolkit for Modeling 
and Simulation of Resource Management Techniques in Internet of Things, Edge and 
Fog Computing Environments.

- [EdgeCloudSim](https://github.com/CagataySonmez/EdgeCloudSim): EdgeCloudSim: An 
Environment for Performance Evaluation of Edge Computing Systems.

- [pFogSim](https://github.com/jihall77/pFogSim): pFogSim (/p/-fôg-/sɪm/) is a 
play off iFogSim; A simulator made to handle large-scale FOG networks with the 
HAFA Puddle Strategy to help evaluate the potential advantages/disadvantages 
within user-customizable scenarios.

- [Veins LTE](http://veins-lte.car2x.org/): Veins LTE is a simulator for 
heterogeneous vehicular networks. It provides fine-grained simulation of vehicular
networks based on IEEE 802.11p and TE.

- [CloudSim](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsim): CloudSim goal is to provide 
a generalized and extensible simulation framework that enables modeling, simulation,
and experimentation of emerging Cloud computing infrastructures and application 
services, allowing its users to focus on specific system design issues that they 
want to investigate, without getting concerned about the low level details related 
to Cloud-based infrastructures and services.

- [CloudSimSDN](https://github.com/Cloudslab/cloudsimsdn): An SDN extension of
CloudSim project to simulate SDN features in the context of a cloud data center.
CloudSimSDN supports calculating power consumption by both hosts and switches.
For instance, network-aware VM placement policies can be evaluated using CloudSimSDN.

- [lightMANO](https://github.com/lightmano/lightmano-core): A lightweight distributed
service orchestrator designed for resource constrained multi-access edge computing
environments.

# Frameworks
- [OMNeT++](https://github.com/omnetpp/omnetpp): OMNeT++ is a public-source, 
component-based, modular and open-architecture simulation environment with strong
GUI support and an embeddable simulation kernel. Its primary application area is
the simulation of communication networks, but it has been successfully used in 
other areas like the simulation of IT systems, queueing networks, hardware 
architectures and business processes as well.

- [EdgeNet](https://github.com/EdgeNet-Project): edgeNet is a distributed edge
cloud, in the family of PlanetLab, GENI, Canada’s SAVI infrastructure, Japan’s 
JGN-X, Germany’s G-Lab, and PlanetLab Europe. It is a modern distributed edge 
cloud, incorporating advances in Cloud technologies over the past few years.

# Test (data, benchmark)
- [DeFog](https://github.com/qub-blesson/DeFog): DeFog, a first Fog benchmarking 
suite to: (i) alleviate the burden of Fog benchmarking by using a standard 
methodology, and (ii) facilitate the understanding of the target platform by 
collecting a catalogue of relevant metrics for a set of benchmarks.
